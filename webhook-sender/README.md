## Getting Started

I recommend running this on [repl.it](https://repl.it) since it's easy to use and sets up all the dependencies for you. I just also want to give credit to [saox](https://github.com/saousername) for helping me with the back-end system. I button will be at the top of this page to run it on repl. If you don't want to run it on repl, then you can follow the simple guides below on getting it setup.

## Setting it Up

I'd reccomend installing the API first and then the Front-end. 
They have their own guides in their folders.

## Information

Please note that not all my projects are open source. This is because that I want to keep some of them Private for the reason that they're so spectacular that I want them to be my own. I hope this doesn't bother you though.
