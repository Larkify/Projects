## Getting Started

I recommend running this on [repl.it](https://repl.it) since it's easy to use and sets up all the dependencies for you. I just also want to give credit to [saox](https://github.com/saousername) for helping me with the back-end system. I button will be at the top of this page to run it on repl. If you don't want to run it on repl, then you can follow the simple guides below on getting it setup.

## Setting it Up

I'd reccomend installing the API first and then the Front-end. 
They have their own guides in their folders.

## Information

I won't be providing too much help with this project as it's only on here if developers want to run their own version, if you don't know what you're doing then don't try installing it. Just use my Live Version.
