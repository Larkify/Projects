## Who is Lark?

If you'd like to know a bit about me, then you've come to the right place. I'm a TikToker from the UK who posts content based around technology and computing. Every now and again I like to relax and casually game. I also have basic knowledge in coding languages such as Discord.JS, Python, PHP, HTML & Much more. It all depends on what I'm in the mood for. I don't claim myself as an expert of any language, but I like equally spreading my intrest across multiple languages.

## My Projects

This area index's all my projects is no order. The coding languages vary a lot but never the less, I love them all!

## Information

Please note that not all my projects are open source. This is because that I want to keep some of them Private for the reason that they're so spectacular that I want them to be my own. I hope this doesn't bother you though.
